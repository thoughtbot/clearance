    # The domain to use for the clearance remember token cookie.

    # A lambda called to set the remember token cookie expires attribute.
    # The lambda accepts the collection of cookies as an argument which
    # allows for changing the expiration according to those cookies.
    # This could be used, for example, to set a session cookie unless
    # a `remember_me` cookie was also present. By default, cookie expiration
    # is one year. For more on cookie expiration see

    # @return [String]
    attr_accessor :cookie_path

    # Controls whether the  HttpOnly flag should be set on the remember token
    # cookie. Defaults to `false`. If `true`, the cookie will not be made

    # `rails generate clearance:routes`.

    # Defaults to `false`. When set, the browser will only send the
    # cookie to the server over HTTPS. You should set this value to true in
    # live environments to prevent session hijacking. For more, see
    # [RFC6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.2.5).

    # The array of sign in guards to run when signing a user in.
    # Defaults to an empty array. Sign in guards respond to `call` and are
    # initialized with a session and the current stack. Each guard can decide
    # to fail the sign in, yield to the next guard, or allow the sign in.
    # @return [Array<#call>]

    # Controls whether user password checks should be deferred to happen at the
    # sign in guard stack. This feature enables a DeferredSignInUser object to
    # enter within sign in guards, regardless if the user is authenticated or
    # not.  Clearance's default behavior is to represent an unauthenticated
    # user as nil, and this is undesirable if we need sign in guards to work
    # with existing but unauthenticated user objects.
