  # Clearance provides Rails routing constraints that can control access and the
  # visibility of routes at the routing layer. The {Constraints::SignedIn}
  # constraint can be used to make routes visible only to signed in users. The
  # {Constraints::SignedOut} constraint can be used to make routes visible only
  # to signed out users.
