module Clearance
  # Required to be included in your configued user class, which is `User` by
  # default, but can be changed with {Configuration#user_model=}.
  #
  #     class User

  #
  # ## Validations
  #
  # These validations are added to the class that the {User} module is mixed
  # into.
  #
  # * If {#email_optional?} is false, {#email} is validated for presence,
  #   uniqueness and email format (using the `email_validator` gem in strict
  #   mode).
  # * If {#skip_password_validation?} is false, {#password} is validated
  #   for presence.
  #
  # ## Callbacks
  #
  # * {#normalize_email} will be called on `before_validation`
  # * {#generate_remember_token} will be called on `before_create`

  #   @return [String] Transient (non-persisted) attribute that is set when

  #
  # @!method password=
  #   Sets the user's encrypted_password by using the configured Password
  #   Strategy's `password=` method. By default, this will be

  #
  # @!method self.authenticate
  #   Finds the user with the given email and authenticates them with the

  #   password is correct for that user, this method will return that user.
  #   Otherwise it will return nil.

  #
  # @!method self.normalize_email
  #   Normalizes the provided email by downcasing and removing all spaces.

  #   validating a user to ensure only normalized emails are stored in the
  #   database.
