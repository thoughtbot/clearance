# News

The noteworthy changes for each Clearance version are included here. For a
complete changelog, see the git history for each version via the version links.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- Removed support for Ruby versions older than 2.3
- Removed support for Rails versions older than 4.2
- Removed all deprecated code from Clearance 1.x

### Changed

- Flash messages now use `flash[:alert]` rather than `flash[:notice]` as they
  were used as errors more often than notices.

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.17.0...HEAD

## [1.17.0] - April 11, 2019

### Changed

- Update the `HttpOnly` cookie setting for the remember token to default to
  true, which prevents the value from being available to JavaScript.
- Add configuration option to allow the auth backdoor to work in specified
  environments (defaults to `test`, `development`, `ci`).

[1.17.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.16.2...1.17.0
## [1.16.2] - February 25, 2019

### Fixed
- Added missing translation keys
- Fix issue where a cookie value could be set more than once when interacting
  with the `httponly` option

### Changed
- Remove Rails as a dependency so that clearance does not trigger a cascade of
  requirements as rails pulls in every framework. Instead, depend on just the
  frameworks relevant to Clearance.
- Prevent `Clearance::BackDoor` from being used outside the "test" environment.

[1.16.2]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.16.1...v1.16.2

## [1.16.1] - November 2, 2017

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where tokens from abandoned password reset attempts were stored in
  the session, preventing newly generated password reset tokens from working.
- Improve compatibility with Rails API projects by calling `helper_method` only
  when it is defined.
- URL fragment in server-set `session[:return_to]` values are preserved when
  redirecting to the stored value.
- Eliminated deprecation in Clearance test helpers that were related to the
  renaming of FactoryGirl to FactoryBot.

[1.16.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.16.0...v1.16.1

## [1.16.0] - January 16, 2017

### Security
- Clearance users can now help prevent [session fixation attacks] by setting
  `Clearance.configuration.rotate_csrf_on_sign_in` to `true`. This will cause
  the user's CSRF token to be rotated on sign in and is recommended for all
  Clearance applications. This setting will default to `true` in Clearance 2.0.
  Clearance will emit a warning on each sign in until this configuration setting
  is explicitly set to `true` or `false`.

[1.16.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.15.1...v1.16.0

## [1.15.1] - October 6, 2016

### Fixed
- Password reset form redirect no longer uses a named route helper, which means
  it will work for developers that have customized their routes.

[1.15.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.15.0...v1.15.1

## [1.15.0] - September 26, 2016

### Security
- Prevent possible password reset token leak to external sites linked to on the
  password reset page. See [PR #707] for more information.

[PR #707]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/pull/707
[1.15.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.14.2...v1.15.0

## [1.14.2] - August 10, 2016

### Fixed
- Fixed incompatibility with `attr_encrypted` gem by inlining the body of the
  `encrypt` helper method used in the BCrypt password strategy.

[1.14.2]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.14.1...v1.14.2

## [1.14.1] - May 12, 2016

### Fixed
- Fixed insertion of `include Clearance::User` when running the install
  generator in an app that already has a `User` model.
- Updated `deny_access` matcher to assert against configured redirect location
  rather than hard coded `/`.

[1.14.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.14.0...v1.14.1

## [1.14.0] - April 29, 2016

### Added
- `Clearance::BackDoor` now accepts a block, allowing the user for a test to be
  looked up by a parameter other than `id` if you have overridden `to_param` for
  the `User` model.

### Fixed
- We now correctly track the dirty state of `User#encrypted_password`, which
  fixes custom validations on `User#password` (e.g. validating password length)
  that were conditional on the password actually changing.
- The `clearance:install` generator will now generate a `User` model that
  inherits from `ApplicationRecord` if run on a Rails 5 app that doesn't already
  have a `User` model.

### Deprecated
- `User#password_changing` is deprecated in favor of automatic dirty tracking on
  `encrypted_password` and `password`. If you are calling this in your
  application you should be able to remove it.

[1.14.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.13.0...v1.14.0

## [1.13.0] - March 4, 2016

### Added
- Clearance now supports Rails 5.0.0.beta3 and newer.

### Fixed
- Clearance will now infer the parameter name to use when accessing user
  parameters in a request. This previously used `:user`, which was incorrect for
  customized user models.
- Generated feature specs no longer rely on RSpec monkey patches.

[1.13.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.12.1...v1.13.0

## [1.12.1] - January 7, 2016

### Fixed
- Fixed the `create_users` migration generated by `rails generate
  clearance:install` under Rails 3.x.

[1.12.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.12.0...v1.12.1

## [1.12.0] - November 17, 2015

### Added
- Users will now see a flash message when redirected to sign in by
  `require_login`. This I18n key for this message is
  `flashes.failure_when_not_signed_in` and defaults to "Please sign in to
  continue".
- Added significant API documentation. API documentation effort is ongoing.

### Fixed
- Fixed expectation in the generated `visitor_resets_password_spec.rb` file.
- Corrected indentation of routes inserted by the routes generator.
- Corrected indentation of `include Clearance::User` when the install generator
  adds it to an existing user class.

[1.12.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.11.0...v1.12.0

## [1.11.0] - August 21, 2015

### Added
- Add `sign_in` and `sign_in_as` helper methods to view specs. These helpers
  avoid errors from verified partial doubles that come from. See
  [462c009].

### Fixed
- `clearance:routes` generator now properly disables internal routes in your
  Clearance initializer.
- Clearance now accesses the cookie jar via ActionDispatch::Request rather than
  `Rack::Request`. This is more consistent with what Rails does internally.

### Deprecated
- `Clearance::Testing::Helpers` has been deprecated in favor of
  `Clearance::Testing::ControllerHelpers`. Most users are accessing these
  helpers by requiring `clearance/rspec` or `clearance/test_unit` and should be
  unaffected.

[462c009]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/commit/462c00965c14b2492500fbb4fecd7b84b9790bb9
[1.11.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.10.1...v1.11.0

## [1.10.1] - May 15, 2015

### Deprecated
- All clearance-provided password strategies other than BCrypt have been
  deprecated. You can continue to use those strategies without a deprecation
  warning by adding `clearance-deprecated_password_strategies` to your Gemfile.

[1.10.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.9.0...v1.10.1

## [1.9.0] - April 3, 2015

### Added
- The change password mailer now produces a multipart message which includes a
  text part along with the previously existing HTML part. To override the text
  part, add `change_password.text.erb` alongside your `change_password.html.erb`
  file.

### Fixed
- Custom `user_model` configured in a Rails initializer will now be reloaded in
  development mode.
- Change password template now contains "Change my password" link text to
  address an issue linking the URL in some mail clients.

[1.9.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.8.1...v1.9.0

## [1.8.1] - March 3, 2015

### Security

  [7f5d56e](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/commit/7f5d56ed3a51aca14fa60247a90ca0cd11db0e0d).

### Fixed
- All methods included by `Clearance::Controller` are now excluded from
  `action_methods`.

[1.8.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.8.0...v1.8.1

## [1.8.0] - January 23, 2015

### Added
- The remember token cookie name is now customizable via
  `Clearance.configuration.cookie_name`.

### Fixed
- Fixed a redirect loop on the sign in page for applications that are still
  using the deprecated `authorize` filter.
- Signed in users that attempt to visit the sign in path are now redirected. The
  redirect URL defaults to the same URL used for the redirect after sign in, but
  can be customized by overriding `passwords_controller#url_for_signed_in_users`

### Deprecated
- `users_controller#avoid_sign_in` is now deprecated in favor of
  `redirect_signed_in_users` which is more accurately named.

[1.8.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0

## [1.7.0] - January, 8, 2015

### Fixed
- Fix the negation of the `deny_access` matcher in Rails 4.0.x on Ruby 2.2

### Deprecated
- The `authorize` filter has been deprecated in favor of `require_login`. Update
  all reference to the filter including any calls to `skip_before_filter` or
  `skip_before_action`.
- The `Clearance.root` method has been deprecated. It was used internally and
  unlikely to impact external users.

[1.7.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.6.1...v1.7.0

## [1.6.1] - January 6, 2015

### Fixed

  RSpec 3 projects.

[1.5.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.5.0...v1.5.1

## [1.5.0] - October 17, 2014

### Added
- Disable clearance routes by setting `config.routes = false`.
- Running `rails generate clearance:routes` will dump the default set of
  routes to your application's routes file for modification.

[1.5.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.4.3...v1.5.0

## [1.4.3] - October 3, 2014

### Fixed

  is nil.

[1.4.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1

## [1.4.0] - July 18, 2014

### Added
- `user_params` method was added to `Clearance::UsersController` which provides
  a convenient place to override the parameters used when creating users.
- Controllers now inherit from `Clearance::BaseController` to allow for easily
  adding behavior to all of them.

### Changed
- The sign out link in the default application layout has been replaced with a
  semantically correct sign out button. This also removes an unnecessary
  JavaScript dependency.

### Fixed
- Clearance now uses `original_fullpath` when redirecting to a saved URL after
  login. This should improve the behavior in mounted engines.

[1.4.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0

## [1.3.0] - March 14, 2014

### Added

- Sign in can now be disabled with `config.allow_sign_in = false`

### Changed
- Sign in failure message is now customized exclusively via I18n.

  customize the message, change the
  `clearance.controllers.sessions.bad_email_or_password` or
  `flashes.failure_after_create` key.

### Deprecated
- `clearance/testing` is now deprecated. Require `clearance/rspec` or
  `clearance/test_unit` as appropriate.

[1.2.0]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0

## [1.1.0] - November 21, 2013

### Added

### Added
- Better email validation regular expression.

### Removed

### Fixed
- Added `defined?` checks for various Rails constants such as `ActionController`

[0.6.7]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v0.6.6...v0.6.7

## [0.6.6] - May 18, 2009

### Fixed
- replaced `class_eval` in `Clearance::User` with modules. This was needed
  so we could write our own validations.

[0.6.6]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v0.6.5...v0.6.6

## [0.6.5] - May 17, 2009

### Added

[0.6.5]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v0.6.4...v0.6.5

## [0.6.4] - May 12, 2009

### Changed
- Replacing `sign_in_as` & `sign_out` shoulda macros with a stubbing (requires no

  email confirmed user from clearance's factories.
- Move private methods on sessions controller into `Clearance::Authentication`
  module.
- Audited flash keys.

## [0.6.1] - April 21, 2009

### Changed

  revert so they're back in the library now for constants referenced inside of
  the gem.

[0.6.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1

## [0.6.0] - April 21, 2009

### Changed
- Converted Clearance to a Rails engine.
- Include `Clearance::User` in User model in app.
- Include `Clearance::Authentication` in `ApplicationController`.
- Namespace controllers under `Clearance` module.
- Routes move to engine, use namespaced controllers but publicly the same.
- If you want to override a controller, subclass it like `SessionsController <
  Clearance::SessionsController`. This gives you access to usual hooks such as
  `url_after_create`.
- Controllers, mailer, model, routes all unit tested inside engine. Use
  `script/generate clearance_features` to test integration of Clearance with your
  Rails app. No longer including modules in your app's test files.
- Moved views to engine.
- Converted generated `test/factories/clearance.rb` to use inheritence for
  `email_confirmed_user`.
- Corrected some spelling errors with methods.
- Loading clearance routes after rails routes via some monkeypatching.
- Made the clearance controllers `unloadable` to stop constant loading errors in
  development mode.

  "Rack-based lazy-loaded sessions",
- Altered generator to interact with `application_controller.rb` instead of
  `application.rb` in Rails 2.3 apps.

[0.5.1]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1

[0.4.9]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v0.4.8...v0.4.9

## [0.4.5] - February 9, 2009

### Added
- Added password reset feature to `clearance_features` generator.

### Changed
- Only store location for `session[:return_to]` for GET requests.
- Audited "sign up" naming convention. "Register" had slipped in a few places.
- Switched to `SHA1` encryption. Cypher doesn't matter much for email
  confirmation, password reset. Better to have shorter hashes in the emails for
  clients who line break on 72 chars.

### Removed
- Removed email downcasing because local-part is case sensitive per
  RFC5321.
- Removed unnecessary `session[:salt]`.

[0.4.5]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/compare/v0.4.4...v0.4.5
