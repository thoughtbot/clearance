Thank you to all the [contributors](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/graphs/contributors)!

New on MASTER
* Overriding clearance controllers is now simpler. The congiuration options
  `users_controller`, `sessions_controller`, and `passwords_controller` can be
  changed to point to the controller of your choosing.

New for 1.3.0 (March 14, 2014)
* Installing Clearance with an existing User model will now create a migration
  that includes adding remember tokens to all existing user records.

New for 1.2.1 (March 6, 2014):
* Query string is now included in the redirect URL when Clearance redirects to a
  previously stored URL.

New for 1.2.0 (February 28, 2014):
* Support for Rails 4.1.0.rc1
* `clearance/testing` is now deprecated. Require `clearance/rspec` or
  `clearance/test_unit` as appropriate.
* Sign in failure message is now customized exclusively via I18n.
  `SessionsController#flash_failure_after_create` is no longer called. To
  customize the message, change the
  `clearance.controllers.sessions.bad_email_or_password` or
  `flashes.failure_after_create` key.
* Sign in can now be disabled with `config.allow_sign_in = false`

New for 1.1.0 (November 21, 2013):

* Validate email with `EmailValidator` [strict mode][strict].
* The `cookie_expiration` configuration lambda can now be called with  a
  `cookies` parameter. Allows the Clearance cookie expiration to be set
  according to the value of another cookie (such as `remember_me`).
* A `cookie_expiration` lambda that does not accept this `cookies`
  parameter has been deprecated.
* Allow cookie domain and path configuration.
* Add sign in guards.
* Don't allow logins with blank `remember_token`.

* Improved language of Cucumber steps by allowing a little more flexibility.

New for 0.10.0 (June 29, 2010):

* If you want to override a controller, subclass it like `SessionsController <
  Clearance::SessionsController`. This gives you access to usual hooks such as
  `url_after_create`.

  `script/generate clearance_features` to test integration of Clearance with your
  Rails app. No longer including modules in your app's test files.
* Moved views to engine.

  "Rack-based lazy-loaded sessions",
* Altered generator to interact with `application_controller.rb` instead of
  `application.rb` in Rails 2.3 apps.

  reasons.
