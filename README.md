Rails authentication with email & password.

Clearance was extracted out of [Airbrake](http://airbrake.io/). It is intended
to be small, simple, well-tested, with easy to override defaults.

Use [Github Issues](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/issues) for help.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute.

Install
-------

Clearance is a Rails engine tested against [Rails 3.x](/Appraisals) on Ruby
1.9.x and Ruby 2.0.x.

Include the gem in your Gemfile:

    gem 'clearance', '1.0.0.rc7'

Bundle:

    bundle --binstubs

Make sure the development database exists. Then, run the generator:

    rails generate clearance:install

The generator:

* inserts `Clearance::User` into your `User` model
* inserts `Clearance::Controller` into your `ApplicationController`
* creates a migration that either creates a users table or adds only missing
  columns

Then, follow the instructions output from the generator.

Use Clearance [0.8.8](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/tree/v0.8.8)
series for Rails 2 apps.

Use [0.16.3](http://rubygems.org/gems/clearance/versions/0.16.3) for Ruby 1.8.7.

Configure
---------

Override any of these defaults in `config/initializers/clearance.rb`:

    Clearance.configure do |config|
      config.cookie_expiration = lambda { 1.year.from_now.utc }
      config.secure_cookie = false
      config.mailer_sender = 'reply@example.com'
      config.password_strategy = Clearance::PasswordStrategies::BCrypt
      config.user_model = User
      config.redirect_url = '/'
    end

Use
---

Use `current_user`, `signed_in?`, and `signed_out?` in controllers, views, and
helpers. For example:

    - if signed_in?
      = current_user.email
      = link_to 'Sign out', sign_out_path, method: :delete
    - else
      = link_to 'Sign in', sign_in_path

To authenticate a user elsewhere than `sessions/new` (like in an API):

    User.authenticate 'email@example.com', 'password'

When a user resets their password, Clearance delivers them an email. So, you
should change the `mailer_sender` default, used in the email's "from" header:

    Clearance.configure do |config|
      config.mailer_sender = 'reply@example.com'
    end

Use `authorize` to control access in controllers:

    class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
      before_filter :authorize

      def index
        current_user.articles
      end
    end

Or, you can authorize users in `config/routes.rb`:

    Blog::Application.routes.draw do
      constraints Clearance::Constraints::SignedIn.new { |user| user.admin? } do
        root to: 'admin'
      end

      constraints Clearance::Constraints::SignedIn.new do
        root to: 'dashboard'
      end

      constraints Clearance::Constraints::SignedOut.new do
        root to: 'marketing'
      end
    end

Clearance adds its session to the Rack environment hash so middleware and other
Rack applications can interact with it:

    class Bubblegum::Middleware
      def initialize(app)
        @app = app
      end

      def call(env)
        if env[:clearance].signed_in?
          env[:clearance].current_user.bubble_gum
        end

        @app.call(env)
      end
    end

Overriding routes
-----------------

See [config/routes.rb](/config/routes.rb) for the default behavior.

To override a Clearance route, redefine it:

    resource :session, controller: 'sessions'

Overriding controllers
----------------------

See [app/controllers/clearance](/app/controllers/clearance) for the default
behavior.

To override a Clearance controller, subclass it:

    class PasswordsController < Clearance::PasswordsController
    class SessionsController < Clearance::SessionsController
    class UsersController < Clearance::UsersController

Then, override public methods:

    passwords#create
    passwords#edit
    passwords#new
    passwords#update
    sessions#create
    sessions#destroy
    sessions#new
    users#create
    users#new

Or, override private methods:

    passwords#find_user_by_id_and_confirmation_token
    passwords#find_user_for_create
    passwords#find_user_for_edit
    passwords#find_user_for_update
    passwords#flash_failure_after_create
    passwords#flash_failure_after_update
    passwords#flash_failure_when_forbidden
    passwords#forbid_missing_token
    passwords#forbid_non_existent_user
    passwords#url_after_create
    passwords#url_after_update
    sessions#flash_failure_after_create
    sessions#url_after_create
    sessions#url_after_destroy
    users#flash_failure_after_create
    users#url_after_create
    users#user_from_params

All of these controller methods redirect to `'/'` by default:

    passwords#url_after_update
    sessions#url_after_create
    users#url_after_create
    application#url_after_denied_access_when_signed_in

To override them all at once, change the global configuration:

    Clearance.configure do |config|
      config.redirect_url = '/overriden'
    end

Overriding translations
-----------------------

All flash messages and email subject lines are stored in
[i18n translations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html).
Override them like any other translation.

See [config/locales/clearance.en.yml](/config/locales/clearance.en.yml) for the
default behavior.

Overriding views
----------------

See [app/views](/app/views) for the default behavior.

To override a view, create your own:

    app/views/clearance_mailer/change_password.html.erb
    app/views/passwords/create.html.erb
    app/views/passwords/edit.html.erb
    app/views/passwords/new.html.erb
    app/views/sessions/_form.html.erb
    app/views/sessions/new.html.erb
    app/views/users/_form.html.erb
    app/views/users/new.html.erb

There is a shortcut to copy all Clearance views into your app:

    rails generate clearance:views

Overriding the model
--------------------

See [lib/clearance/user.rb](/lib/clearance/user.rb) for the default behavior.

To override the model, redefine public methods:

    .authenticate(email, password)
    #forgot_password!
    #reset_remember_token!
    #update_password(new_password)

Or, redefine private methods:

    #email_optional?
    #generate_confirmation_token
    #generate_remember_token
    #normalize_email
    #password_optional?

Overriding the password strategy
--------------------------------

By default, Clearance uses BCrypt encryption of the user's password.

See
[lib/clearance/password_strategies/bcrypt.rb](/lib/clearance/password_strategies/bcrypt.rb)
for the default behavior.

Change your password strategy in `config/initializers/clearance.rb:`

    Clearance.configure do |config|
      config.password_strategy = Clearance::PasswordStrategies::SHA1
    end

Clearance provides the following strategies:

    config.password_strategy = Clearance::PasswordStrategies::BCrypt
    config.password_strategy = Clearance::PasswordStrategies::BCryptMigrationFromSHA1
    config.password_strategy = Clearance::PasswordStrategies::Blowfish
    config.password_strategy = Clearance::PasswordStrategies::SHA1

The previous default password strategy was SHA1.

Switching password strategies may cause your existing users to not be able to sign in.

If you have an existing app that used the old `SHA1` strategy and you want to
stay with SHA1, use
[Clearance::PasswordStrategies::SHA1](/lib/clearance/password_strategies/sha1.rb).

If you have an existing app that used the old `SHA1` strategy and you want to
switch to BCrypt transparently, use
[Clearance::PasswordStrategies::BCryptMigrationFromSHA1](/lib/clearance/password_strategies/bcrypt_migration_from_sha1.rb).

The SHA1 and Blowfish password strategies require an additional `salt` column in
the `users` table. Run this migration before switching to SHA or Blowfish:

    class AddSaltToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def change
        add_column :users, :salt, :string, limit: 128
      end
    end

You can write a custom password strategy that has two instance methods:

    module CustomPasswordStrategy
      def authenticated?
      end

      def password=(new_password)
      end
    end

    Clearance.configure do |config|
      config.password_strategy = CustomPasswordStrategy
    end

Optional feature specs
----------------------

You can generate feature specs to help prevent regressions in Clearance's
integration with your Rails app over time.

Edit your `Gemfile` to include the dependencies:

    gem 'capybara', '~> 2.0'
    gem 'factory_girl_rails', '~> 4.2'
    gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 2.13'

Generate RSpec files:

    rails generate rspec:install

Generate Clearance specs:

    rails generate clearance:specs

Run the specs:

    rake

Testing authorized controller actions
-------------------------------------

To test controller actions that are protected by `before_filter :authorize`,
include Clearance's test helpers and matchers in `spec/support/clearance.rb` or
`test/test_helper.rb`:

    require 'clearance/testing'

This will make `Clearance::Controller` methods work in your controllers
during functional tests and provide access to helper methods like:

    sign_in
    sign_in_as(user)
    sign_out

And matchers like:

    deny_access

Example:

    context 'a guest' do
      before do
        get :show
      end

      it { should deny_access }
    end

    context 'a user' do
      before do
        sign_in
        get :show
      end

      it { should respond_with(:success) }
    end

You may want to customize the tests:

    it { should deny_access  }
    it { should deny_access(flash: 'Denied access.')  }
    it { should deny_access(redirect: sign_in_url)  }

Faster tests
------------

Clearance includes middleware that avoids wasting time spent visiting, loading,
and submitting the sign in form. It instead signs in the designated
user directly. The speed increase can be
[substantial](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/37907699673/faster-tests-sign-in-through-the-back-door).

Configuration:

    # config/environments/test.rb
    MyRailsApp::Application.configure do
      # ...
      config.middleware.use Clearance::BackDoor
      # ...
    end

Usage:

    visit root_path(as: user)
